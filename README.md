# Tempus Dominus Date/Time Picker v6.0.0-alpha

Version 6 is a complex "coming when it's ready". You can read the very high level tasks that need to be done before it's ready [here](https://github.com/Eonasdan/bootstrap-datetimepicker/issues/2326).


# Bootstrap 3 Date/Time Picker v4.17.47

The old bootstrap 3 version is no longer supported and issues/prs relating to this will be closed except for security vulerabilites etc. The code base for this is in the v4 branch.
